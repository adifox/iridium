      <h2>Whats Iridium and why</h2>
      <p>
        Iridium is a chemical element with the symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A
        very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum
        group, iridium is considered to be the second-densest metal (after
        osmium) with a density of 22.56 g/cm3 as defined by experimental X-ray
        crystallography. However, at room temperature and standard atmospheric
        pressure, iridium has been calculated to have a density of 22.65 g/cm3,
        0.04 g/cm3 higher than osmium measured the same way.[5] Still, the
        experimental X-ray crystallography value is considered to be the most
        accurate, and as such iridium is considered to be the second densest
        element.[6] It is the most corrosion-resistant metal, even at
        temperatures as high as 2000 Â°C. Although only certain molten salts and
        halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is
        much more reactive and can be flammable.
